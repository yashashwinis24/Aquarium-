Aquarium

Project Objective
To design and develop an interactive animated aquarium using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that simulates a lively underwater environment through moving fish, animated waves, bubbles, and responsive elements. The project aims to demonstrate core web-development concepts—such as animation, DOM manipulation, user interaction, and SVG graphics—while creating a visually engaging and dynamic digital experience.
